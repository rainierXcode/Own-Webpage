        <p>
          Here on this page, my story unfolds a tale of decisions, aspirations,
          and growth. Let's embark on this journey together.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the horizon of college approached, I faced the formidable task of
          choosing a course that would shape my future.
          <a
            href="javascript:void(0);"
            onclick="toggleSection('collegeApproach', 'collegeApproachLink')"
            id="collegeApproachLink"
            >Read more</a
          >
        </p>

        <div id="collegeApproach" style="display: none">
          <p>
            In those high school days, I believed that a popular engineering
            course would guarantee success. With my math skills not far from
            impressive, I dabbled in drafting, eager to lay my foundation.
          </p>

          <p>
            But the pandemic swept in, shattering my illusions. It became
            evident that a course alone couldn't carve a path to success; it was
            about how I shaped it. A humbling realization led me to conclude
            that engineering wasn't my calling. A search for my true passion
            commenced.
          </p>

          <p>
            Enter Don Honorio Ventura State University (DHVSU), my beacon of
            hope. From a myriad of courses, two caught my eye Computer Science
            and Information Technology. After careful contemplation, I chose
            Information Technology, influenced by DHVSU's extension campus near
            my home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anticipating the journey ahead, I immersed myself in self-study,
            tackling the enigmatic realm of programming. From
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program"
              target="_blank"
              >Hello World</a
            >
            to more complex codes, I treaded this path before college, arming
            myself with a semblance of knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>
            College days arrived, and with them, the realization that knowing
            the terms wasn't enough. Solving problems independently presented
            challenges. My mind knew conditionals, yet struggled to apply them.
            This marked the genesis of true progress.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mistakes turned into stepping stones as I delved into programming
            logic. YouTube tutorials taught me how to think like a programmer,
            and a beacon of enlightenment appeared CS50. Through
            <a
              href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python"
              target="_blank"
              >CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python</a
            >, I revisited the basics, appreciating the nuances of correct
            coding.
          </p>

          <p>
            My academic journey intertwined with the CS50 course, expanding my
            prowess. But, as an honors student, time became a rarity. Completion
            of the CS50 journey demanded a
            <a
              href="https://github.com/rainierXcode/CS50P-Final-Project"
              target="_blank"
              >final project</a
            >
            my creation inspired by ChatGpt. A chatbot, a manual response system
            driven by input probabilities, emerged.
          </p>

          <p>
            CS50X beckoned, and I ventured into HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            Lectures imparted knowledge, but before solving problems, I plunged
            into the
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard" target="_blank"
              >Odin Project</a
            >, crafting projects like
            <a href="https://github.com/rainierXcode/Rock-Paper-Scissor"
              >rock-paper-scissors
            </a>
            and a

              >calculator</a
            >, fostering independent creativity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond programming, college life thrived. Despite the challenges,
            being an honor student and aspiring programmer, I managed to excel.
            My first-year accolades include President Lister and Most
            Outstanding Student in my department.

            As the second year rolled in, this webpage emerged, encapsulating my
            growth. It's more than just a programming journey; it's a testament
            to my pursuit of personal success. My dreams aren't extravagant;
            they involve the freedom to reward my parents and myself. This
            webpage stands as a reminder a virtual pat on the back, urging me
            forward.
          </p>

          <p>
            So here we are, traversing the chapters of my story, from course
            choices to academic achievements, and beyond. The journey is far
            from over, but looking back, I've come a long way, and that's
            something to be proud of.
