          <hr>
          <p>Well, since you've learned that I lean more towards introversion, you might be intrigued about what goes on in my world, right? Allow me to invite you into the realm of my interests and hobbies.</p>
          <p>Imagine this: the flicker of a screen, captivating stories, and boundless imagination. Yes, my favorite hobbies center around two worlds anime and technology.</p>

My anime journey has led me through thrilling shonen adventures, where heroes rise against all odds. From the iconic legacy of <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Dragon Ball</a> to the freshest creations of today, I've been on an exhilarating ride. And yes, I must admit, I've often caught myself daydreaming of harnessing Super Saiyan powers, a classic fantasy of anime enthusiasts like me.</p>
          <p>But there's another side of me that craves understanding the inner workings of the world around me. Technology, with its intricacies and potential, has become a compelling passion. Instead of just being a spectator, I've embraced the challenge of studying and mastering it. This isn't just for my future self, but it's also a pursuit that shapes my academic journey. I strive for excellence not just in grades, but in knowledge that I can apply to real-world scenarios.</p>
          <p>And then there's an entirely different twist in my interests the mysterious allure of Kdramas, especially in the enigmatic realm of mystery genre. This fascination has opened up a whole new dimension of storytelling and culture for me.</p>

          <p>So, as you can see, my hobbies paint a vivid picture of a multi-faceted journey from the adrenaline of battles in anime to the logical intricacies of technology and the suspense of Kdrama mysteries.</p>
